# ToDo-List
#### Panel
- [ ] `CoreAdmin->init` check permissions of modal requests (currently not planned how this will be implemented)
- [ ] Adding more hookable `filter` and `actions` to the system
- [ ] Create a documentation & list of the hook-system
- [ ] Create a description of template system & the call hierarchy
- [ ] Create an `Logger` instead of `print`'s (with logger destination (class description), logger types like `Warn`, `Fatal` `Info`, a good stacktrace & other), logger must be multiprintable (tty-colors, html & plain output for sample)
- [ ] Create an interactive **Language Editor** (as module?) for a live editing (combined with panel & modules-strings)
- [ ] Removing get- & setSettings from `I18N` & use the methods from `Core`
- [ ] Rename `Network` to `HTTP` for a better clarity (?)
- [ ] Create a documentation of all classes/methods with their description & parameters?
- [ ] Check if `Router->run` is secure for bad input
- [ ] Create `OS` specific classes for `OperatingSystem`-class with an global API
- [ ] Create an `JSON`-based **API** (can be reaqlized via Theme, this is a bad thing?)
- [ ] Change hardcoded PHP-endpoint on `PHP`-class for more flexibility & versions-support
- [ ] Support librarys in modules (See `Loader`-Class`)?

#### Binary
- [ ] Create a better code structure (class-based?)
- [ ] Reimplement some methods with a better handling?
